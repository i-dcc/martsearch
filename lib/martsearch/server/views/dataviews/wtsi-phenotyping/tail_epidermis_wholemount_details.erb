        Skin screen collaboration (Mice were fed on Mouse Breeder Diet (5021, Labdiet) from weaning): Tails were
        collected in duplicate from mutant and wild type mice of the same genetic background (&ge; 14 weeks). Epidermal
        whole mounts were prepared by separating the epidermis from the underlying dermis as an intact sheet following
        EDTA digestion. The epidermis was fixed in 4&#37; paraformaldehyde and permeabilised, then stained using a rapid
        labelling protocol with antibodies to keratin 14 and 15 (K14, K15) that were directly conjugated with
        fluorophores (Alexa 555 (red) for K14 and 488 (green) for K15). Whole mounts were counter-stained with DAPI to
        reveal cell nuclei (blue). Preparationsâ€™ were imaged using a Leica SP5 Confocal microscope and Maximum Intensity
        Projections produced from &#126;150um Z-series at 4um spacing. DAPI, Alexa 488 and Alexa555 channels were merged.
        Images are x10 magnification unless otherwise indicated.

    <h4>Evaluation of Phenotype</h4> 
    <div class="test-descriptor-content"> 
      <p style="margin-bottom:8px">
        A tick-list was used to record the presence (red cross) or absence (green tick) of a phenotype in the epidermis. 
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom:8px">
        K14 is expressed in basal layer epidermal cells in the interfollicular epidermis (IFE), sebaceous gland (SG) and
        hair follicles (HF). DAPI staining provides an indication of cell density and K15 is most highly expressed in the HF
        bulge, which is a stem cell reservoir.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom:8px">
        In tail epidermis melanocytes reside in the HF and also in the IFE immediately adjacent to the HF (parakeratotic
        scale). In some mutant mice pigmentation in the IFE is altered and this is recorded in bright-field images.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom:8px">
        In the tick-list, abnormal K14 expression would indicate loss of expression. Abnormal K15 expression indicates
        either abnormal bulge morphology or altered K15 expression (for example, reduced in the bulge or up-regulated
        outside the bulge). In tail epidermis the HF are normally arranged in groups of three (triplets) and in
        staggered rows; abnormalities in HF patterning include changes in number of HF per group and distance between
        rows. The hair growth cycle in tail epidermis is less highly synchronised than in the back and the mice analysed
        are not closely age-matched. Therefore, detailed evaluation of the hair cycle has not been performed;
        nevertheless, obvious disturbance, such as all HF being in catagen, is recorded. The SG are K14-positive
        sack-like structures that lie above the bulge; changes in SG size, number or morphology are recorded as
        abnormal. Changes in the IFE include hyperproliferation (detected as increased basal layer density and
        enveloping of the junction with the HF), hypocellularity and altered pigmentation.
